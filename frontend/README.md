# Business Plan

## Executive Summary
The NFT Fashion Company aims to revolutionize the fashion industry by leveraging non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and artificial intelligence (AI) to create unique and limited-edition fashion items. Our platform will allow users to buy and sell fashion NFTs, with each NFT serving as a receipt and proof of ownership for the physical fashion wear. By combining the growing popularity of NFTs with AI-generated fashion images, we aim to tap into a lucrative market and provide a new and exciting way for fashion enthusiasts to engage with their favorite brands.

## Market Analysis
- The NFT market has experienced significant growth in recent years, with a global market size in 2021.
- The fashion industry is a multi-trillion dollar market, with a strong demand for unique and exclusive fashion items.
- By combining the two industries and introducing AI-generated NFT images, we can target fashion enthusiasts and collectors who are interested in owning limited-edition fashion items in digital form.

## Endpoints

DApps using public endpoints may face rate limiting. We used Linea via ['`linea-goerli.infura.io`' or '`polygon-mumbai.infura.io`']. Frontend employed Rainbowkit wallet and RPC endpoint at ["https://polygon-mumbai.infura.io/"].
